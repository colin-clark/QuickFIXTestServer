/**
 * A memstore-local allocation buffer.
 * <p/>
 * The MemtableAllocator is a bump-the-pointer allocator that allocates
 * large (2MB) regions and then doles it out to threads that request
 * slices into the array.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of this class is to combat heap fragmentation in the
 * memtable: by ensuring that all name and value column data in a given memtable refer
 * only to large regions of contiguous memory, we ensure that large blocks
 * get freed up when the memtable is flushed.
 * <p/>
 * Otherwise, the byte array allocated during insertion end up
 * interleaved throughout the heap, and the old generation gets progressively
 * more fragmented until a stop-the-world compacting collection occurs.
 * <p/>
 * TODO: we should probably benchmark whether word-aligning the allocations
 * would provide a performance improvement - probably would speed up the
 * Bytes.toLong/Bytes.toInt calls in KeyValue, but some of those are cached
 * anyway
